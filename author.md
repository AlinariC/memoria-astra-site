    <p>Alinari Campbell is the creator of the <strong>Memoria Astra Cycle</strong>, an epic saga exploring memory, survival, and the eternal harmonies that shape the stars themselves.</p>

    <p>Driven by a lifelong love of speculative fiction, mythology, and cosmic wonder, Alinari weaves worlds where Breath binds reality, and the echoes of ancient civilizations ripple across time and space.</p>

    <p>When not writing, Alinari enjoys stargazing, exploring forgotten places, and imagining what futures might still be written among the Wells of Breath.</p>

    <p>Memoria Astra is more than a series — it’s a remembrance of dreams yet to awaken.</p>
