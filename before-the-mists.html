    <h1>Before the Mists</h1>
    <h2>The Fall of Venus</h2>
    <p>
      Before the Earth was cloaked in mist, before humanity forgot the stars, there was Venus—a world of vibrant skies, crystalline spires, and a people called the Phorsians.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">
      “We sang to the sun as it turned against us, and in its fury, we found our path to the stars.”
    </p>
    <p>
      *Before the Mists* tells the story of the last days of the Phorsian empire, as Venus becomes increasingly uninhabitable. Their skies begin to shimmer with death, and a great migration is planned—skyships that ride the solar wind, ancient science that flirts with myth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by the Watcher, a being as old as memory itself, a people must decide what they carry forward—and what they must leave behind. Secrets buried in the catacombs beneath the sulfur peaks, betrayals in the High Council, and a singular hope carried in a vessel of light.
    </p>

      When a world ends, its story does not. It waits—echoing through the stars, waiting for memory to remember.
