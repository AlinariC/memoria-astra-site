      <h2>The Ashes of Red Worlds</h2>
      <p>On the broken plains of a once-living Mars, relics of the past whisper through crimson dust. Here, the final remnants of ancient travelers left behind tombs, songs, and silent warnings — all but forgotten by those who would come after.</p>
      <p>Amidst shattered canyons and glassed oceans, explorers unearth truths older than memory, and with them, a sorrow that cuts deeper than any blade. Some doors were never meant to be opened. Some legacies were never meant to be unearthed.</p>
      <p>Crimson Reliquary is a story of discovery, mourning, and the heavy price of forgotten dreams, echoing across the stars.</p>
