      <h2>The Dawn Beneath the Shrouds</h2>
      <p>Before memory was shaped into stone and song, Terra breathed beneath the veils of endless mist. Here, at the cradle of existence, towering mountains pierced vaporous oceans, and the first whispers of humanity stirred in awe and fear.</p>
      <p>But the world was not as it would become. Life clung fragilely to the high peaks, and secrets older than breath slumbered within the mists. In the silence before destiny’s shaping, ancient beings and forgotten civilizations left marks that would one day echo across the stars.</p>
      <p>Embark on the first steps of the Memoria Astra Cycle — a journey that begins where memory and dream are born: in the deep, misted heart of a forgotten Earth.</p>
